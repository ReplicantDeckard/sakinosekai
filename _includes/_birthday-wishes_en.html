<p>I will never forget the time when I first discovered SAKI&rsquo;s work. It completely changed my perception of the music world. She instantly became my favorite musician. The songs SAKI has written for Mary&rsquo;s Blood are some of the best metal songs ever composed. As thrash metal, &ldquo;Coronation Day&rdquo; is as good as anything Testament or Forbidden ever made.</p>
<p>Listening to SAKI&rsquo;s passionate performance on the guitar can bring you to tears. &ldquo;SAKI is one of the &lsquo;ideal forms&rsquo; of female guitarists. Not only does she have excellent technique, but the bewitchingness of expressing it with her whole body is gorgeous!&rdquo; said IRONBUNNY&rsquo;s Ediee. Wise cyborg!</p>
<p>I was fortunate to have the opportunity to see SAKI participate in ROCK INST NIGHT with Yashiro, Minari Shun, and Furuya Keisuke at the legendary Kichijouji Silver Elephant in late June. It was an amazing event. Saki&rsquo;s final solo for Gary Moore&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sunset&rdquo; was so moving that Shun said &ldquo;Wow wow wow, wonderful, Saki-chan.&rdquo; Keisuke described her playing as &ldquo;crying guitar&rdquo; &mdash; it is one of the finest guitar solos I have ever heard.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a difficult year, but SAKI worked harder than ever and pushed herself to the limit. Nemophila&rsquo;s first year was full of activity. All of SAKI&rsquo;s TwitCasting streams, tweets, YouTube videos, and guest appearances made me forget about the difficult times. &ldquo;RAITEI&rdquo; is the best song of the year, and &ldquo;Tam Murata Returns! NEMOPHILA 1st Streaming Live&rdquo; is the best event of the year. And it was an unforgettable experience for me to finally be able to &ldquo;go&rdquo; to a Mary&rsquo;s Blood live. I&rsquo;m enormously grateful to her for all her efforts.</p>
<p>SAKI may not be able to do a Birthday Live this year, but I hope that at the very least she has a lovely, wonderful birthday.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, SAKI, for a wonderful year of music and beautiful smiles. Happy Birthday.</p>
